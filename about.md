<p id="text">Hi. 
I'm a 25 year old guy. In the fall of 2018 I started the frontend development education at Nackademin, school of business, in Solna. Together with my partner I live in an appartment in HÃ¤sselby.
On our sparetime we prefer to hang out with family and friends. I also spend alot of time fishing. Fishing has been a hobby for me a couple of years and I have attended a few contests. 
I'm a confident and calm person. I'm very driven and look forward to work with frontend development full time. 
My main goal is to become the best frontend developer that I possibly could be. I also want to develop knowledge in backend development to become as complete as possible within the field. </p>
