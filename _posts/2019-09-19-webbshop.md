Webbshop

My examining assignment in Javascript 2. The goal was to create a webbshop with minimum 10 products, with features like add to cart, quantity, order and validation(regex) on user contact info.
The products should be gathered from a JSON-file and the cart was to be handled by WEB storage api - Local Storage.

Be aware to check out the code on Github because at the point i was fairly new to Javascript and the code is just a mess. But it works &#128515;
