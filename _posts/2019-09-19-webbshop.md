Webbshop

My examining assignment in Javascript 2. 
The goal was to create a webbshop with minimum ten products, with features like add to cart, quantity, order and validation(regex) on user contact info. 
The products should be gathered from a JSON-file and the cart was to be handled by WEB storage api - Local Storage.
Be aware to check out the code on Github. At the moment I made this I was fairly new to Javascript and the code is a mess. &#128515;
